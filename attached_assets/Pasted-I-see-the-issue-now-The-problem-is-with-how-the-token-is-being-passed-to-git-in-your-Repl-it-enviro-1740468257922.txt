I see the issue now. The problem is with how the token is being passed to git in your Repl.it environment. Let's fix your deployment script with a more direct approach that should work in your new Repl.it account.
Here's what to do:

First, verify your GitHub token is correctly set as a secret:

In Repl.it, go to "Secrets" in the Tools panel
Make sure you have GITHUB_TOKEN (case sensitive) with your GitHub personal access token


Now let's modify your deploy script to use the token more explicitly. Create a new file called fixed-deploy.sh with the following content:

bashCopy#!/bin/bash
set -e
echo "ðŸš€ Starting fixed GitHub deployment process..."

# Get current date for commit messages
DEPLOY_DATE=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

# More explicit GitHub token handling
GITHUB_URL="https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/atlasgrowth/bamaelectric.git"

# Step 1: Initialize git if not already initialized
if [ ! -d .git ]; then
  echo "Initializing git repository..."
  git init
  git branch -M main
fi

# Step 2: Configure git remote with explicit token
if git remote -v | grep -q origin; then
  git remote set-url origin "${GITHUB_URL}"
else
  git remote add origin "${GITHUB_URL}"
fi

# Step 3: Configure git user identity (important for Replit)
git config user.name "Replit Deployment"
git config user.email "deployment@example.com"

# Step 4: Save all current changes to main branch
echo "Saving all changes to main branch..."
git add .
git commit -m "Update project code - $DEPLOY_DATE" || echo "No changes to commit"

# Step 5: Push the main branch to GitHub (this stores all your source code)
echo "Pushing source code to main branch..."
git push -u origin main || (echo "Error pushing to main branch. You might need to pull first." && exit 1)

# Step 6: Build the client-side application
echo "Building the client application for GitHub Pages..."
npm run build:client

# Step 7: Prepare and deploy to gh-pages branch
echo "Setting up deployment to gh-pages branch..."
# Create a temporary directory for the deployment
rm -rf .deploy
mkdir -p .deploy
cp -r dist/* .deploy/

# Add special 404.html file for SPA routing
cat > .deploy/404.html << EOF
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Redirecting...</title>
  <script>
    // Redirect to the home page with the current path as a hash
    var path = window.location.pathname;
    window.location.href = '/#' + path;
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Redirecting...</p>
</body>
</html>
EOF

# Navigate to the deploy directory
cd .deploy

# Initialize a new git repository for gh-pages branch
echo "Initializing git repository for gh-pages deployment..."
git init
git checkout -b gh-pages

# Configure git for the deployment
git config user.name "Replit Deployment"
git config user.email "deployment@example.com"

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages - $DEPLOY_DATE"

# Force push to the gh-pages branch with explicit token
echo "Pushing to gh-pages branch..."
git push -f "${GITHUB_URL}" gh-pages

echo "ðŸŽ‰ Deployment complete!"
echo "âœ… Source code pushed to: https://github.com/atlasgrowth/bamaelectric"
echo "âœ… Website deployed to: https://atlasgrowth.github.io/bamaelectric/"

Make the new script executable:

bashCopychmod +x fixed-deploy.sh

Add a new script to your package.json:

jsonCopy"scripts": {
  "deploy:fixed": "bash fixed-deploy.sh"
}

Try running the new deployment script:

bashCopynpm run deploy:fixed
This modified script should work because:

It uses the token directly in the Git URLs
It sets up Git user credentials explicitly
It doesn't rely on the askpass mechanism that's failing

If you still encounter issues, try adding these commands in your Repl.it shell before running the deployment:
bashCopygit config --global credential.helper store
echo "https://oauth2:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com" > ~/.git-credentials
chmod 600 ~/.git-credentials
Let me know if this works or if you're still facing issues!RetryNdoes it send main code to main brnahc too i like when it does that so github is fully up to dteEditYes, the script I provided includes both functions:

It pushes your main code to the main branch first. This happens in Step 5 of the script:

bashCopy# Step 5: Push the main branch to GitHub (this stores all your source code)
echo "Pushing source code to main branch..."
git push -u origin main || (echo "Error pushing to main branch. You might need to pull first." && exit 1)

Then it builds and deploys the built files to the gh-pages branch. This happens in Step 7 and onwards.

This way, your entire GitHub repository stays up to date:

The main branch will contain all your source code
The gh-pages branch will contain the built/compiled files for the live website

The script preserves this dual-branch deployment approach from your original script, just making it more robust for your new Repl.it environment. Your GitHub repository will be fully up to date with all your changes after running the deployment.
